It was while heading up the online customer service for a coffee subscription startup that I was introduced to the wonderful world of software development. After reading some books and doing some online courses I decided to go all-in with this coding thing and applied to [Turing School of Software and Design](https://www.turing.io/).

Turing, easily the best pedagogical experience of my life, changed everything, instilling in me a thirst to know *all the things*. And you can join me on this continuous learning adventure through this online blogging experience. Enjoy.
